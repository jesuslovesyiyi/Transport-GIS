## Overview
This course covers the applications of GIS and emerging spatial technologies in transportation network modeling. Its primary goal is to help students understand the basic principles of geographical information science for transportation modeling and to equip students with state-of-the-practice computing technology.  

The course is appropriate for students who are interested in learning practical implementation of transportation network modeling in both GIS and Python environments. It is also appropriate for those with a GIS background and interested in gaining experience in problems specific to transportation.  

The learning objectives of this course are as follows:  
1. Understand fundamental concepts in GIS that are essential in spatial data processing and transportation network modeling.
2. Build proficiency in key operations in transportation network modeling namely spatial network data structures, network topology, and routing simulations.  
3. Explore creatively and independently the applications of transportation network modeling in GIS and Python environments such as accessibility analysis, urban mobility performance, network criticality analysis etc.  

## Software Availability
ArcGIS Pro 2.x and ArcGIS Desktop 10.x and all available extensions are installed on all College of Design computer labs and clusters. In addition, a number of virtual machine instances have been configured with ArcGIS software on https://mycloud.gatech.edu. The software has been distributed widely to other campus departments including OIT maintained labs.  

## Evaluation
The course will be structured as a combined lecture-lab course. You are expected to have read all assigned readings ahead of time and be prepared to actively participate in class discussions. Students will be evaluated on two sets of tasks: three lab projects and a final course project. The formal requirements of the class are as follows:  

_Three Lab Projects (45%):_  
Through the completion of three lab assignments, students will gain first-hand knowledge of the use and operation of GIS and Python in transportation. For late submissions, a .5 point/day penalty will be applied.  

_Applied Project (15% Presentation, 40% Project paper):_  
The final class requirement is project that applies the knowledge learned in the class to a real-world problem. Students will be provided with full details of the project guidelines and expectations. Fifteen percent of the total course grade will be a formal presentation to the class. Please note that all written assignments (unless otherwise noted) are to be submitted through the “Assignments” tab. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that assignments submitted through Canvas are successfully uploaded into the system.
