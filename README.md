## Overview
This course covers the applications of GIS and emerging spatial technologies in transportation network modeling. Its primary goal is to help students understand the basic principles of geographical information science for transportation modeling and to equip students with state-of-the-practice computing technology.  

The course is appropriate for students who are interested in learning practical implementation of transportation network modeling in both GIS and Python environments. It is also appropriate for those with a GIS background and interested in gaining experience in problems specific to transportation.  

The learning objectives of this course are as follows:  
1. Understand fundamental concepts in GIS that are essential in spatial data processing and transportation network modeling.
2. Build proficiency in key operations in transportation network modeling namely spatial network data structures, network topology, and routing simulations.  
3. Explore creatively and independently the applications of transportation network modeling in GIS and Python environments such as accessibility analysis, urban mobility performance, network criticality analysis etc.
